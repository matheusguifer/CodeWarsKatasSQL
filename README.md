Codewars is a platform that helps you learn, train, and improve your coding skills by solving programming tasks of many types and difficulty levels. You choose how you would like to learn. Do you want to take on increasingly difficult challenges? Maybe you prefer training through repetition and by improving your solutions. After solving a task, compare your answer with other users and learn from them or help less experienced users by answering their questions.

Ranks are used to indicate the proficiency of users and the difficulty of Kata. There are two classes of ranks, Kyu and Dan, which are divided in 8 levels each. By increasing order of proficiency/difficulty:

    8 Kyu to 1 Kyu
    1 Dan to 8 Dan

Why the names Kyu and Dan? The terms are borrowed from a system in Japanese martial arts, which is in turn borrowed from the game of Go. Kyu (or KyÅ«) indicates the number of degrees away from master level (Dan). This is why they count downward. Once you reach master level, we count upward. Black belts in martial arts are Dan level.
